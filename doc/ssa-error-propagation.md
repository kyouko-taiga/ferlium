# SSA error propagation: invoke / landing pad / resume

How a runtime error (`abort`, `panic`, division by zero, array out of bounds, …) unwinds through the
SSA form, running each live local's `Value::drop` exactly once on the way out — modeled as **explicit
SSA control flow**, the way a real backend (LLVM `invoke`/`landingpad`/`resume`) would.

## Why explicit control flow, and not an interpreter-side unwind

The SSA interpreter exists to validate that `emit_ssa` lowers HIR to *semantically correct* SSA that a
real code generator could target. Cleanup on the error path is part of that lowering: a backend needs
the drops-on-unwind expressed as instructions it can emit, not as a runtime convenience hidden inside
the interpreter. So the emitter materializes cleanup as **landing-pad blocks** and the interpreter
merely *executes* them — the same division of labour as for normal-path scope-exit drops.

Contrast the HIR interpreter, which manipulates whole frames and unwinds imperatively in Rust
(`drop_frame_owned_locals_on_error`, `src/eval.rs`). The SSA path cannot do that and still be a
faithful lowering oracle: the cleanup has to live in the IR.

## The three pieces

- **`invoke callee(args) -> bN unwind bM`** — a *fallible* call. A terminator with two successors: on
  normal completion control falls to the continuation `bN`; on a raised `RuntimeError` it transfers to
  the cleanup pad `bM`. Operand layout and callee contract are identical to `call`; only the two
  successor blocks are extra. Infallible calls (and fallible calls with nothing to clean up in their
  frame) stay plain `call`s whose error simply propagates to the caller.
- **landing pad** — an ordinary block that drops one lexical scope's obligations (reverse declaration
  order, init-guarded) and then `br`s to the pad of the nearest enclosing scope with obligations, or,
  if none, `resume`s. Chained inner-to-outer, the pads drop every live frame local exactly once.
- **`resume`** — a terminator with no successors that *continues* the unwind the pad interrupted,
  handing the in-flight error back to the caller. It is not a fresh throw: the error was already
  raised by the original fallible call and merely paused while the pad ran the frame's drops; `resume`
  lifts that pause (the name is LLVM's). The caller's `invoke` at the originating call site catches the
  resumed error and routes it into the caller's own pad — giving the cross-frame unwind, one frame at
  a time.

## Exactly-once drops, for free

Pad drops are the *same* init-guarded `drop` instructions the emitter already places on the normal
path. The structural husk rule (see [ssa-uninit-tracking.md](ssa-uninit-tracking.md);
`is_drop_husk`) skips storage that is already dropped or moved out, so a pad drops **unconditionally**
and a value is still dropped at most once: a local dropped on the normal path before a later call
raises reads back as a husk and is skipped by the pad; a local still live when the call raised is
dropped by the pad; a moved-out local is a husk and skipped (matching the HIR interpreter's
`place_contains_uninit` skip). No drop-flag bookkeeping is needed.

## Which calls become `invoke`

A call is lowered as `invoke` iff its HIR node's effects mark it fallible
(`PrimitiveEffect::Fallible`, or — conservatively — an unresolved effect variable) **and** some
enclosing scope has drop obligations (so there is a pad to run). This mirrors real codegen, where only
calls that can throw and have cleanup use `invoke`, and keeps the lowering of the common
(infallible, or cleanup-free) case unchanged.

## Emitter mechanics: pads are filled last

A block is a contiguous range in a shared instruction arena, so a pad's body cannot be emitted in the
middle of lowering another block — that would splice the pad's drops into the block under
construction. The emitter therefore *allocates* a pad block (empty) the moment an `invoke` needs to
name it, capturing the scope's drop obligations and the outer pad it chains to, and **fills all
pending pads at function finalization**, after the body's last block is terminated. Each pad is then a
clean, contiguous range. See `allocate_pad` / `fill_pending_pads` in `src/emit_ssa.rs`.

## Interpreter mechanics

`run_function` interprets a script callee by recursing in Rust, so it also enforces the same
**call-depth limit** as the HIR interpreter (`CallDepthLimitExceeded`) — otherwise unbounded
recursion would overflow the real stack instead of raising. Within a frame, an `invoke` whose call
raises stashes the error in a frame-local `pending` and `goto`s the unwind pad; the pad's drops run as
ordinary instructions; `resume` returns `Err(pending)` to the caller. A `Value::drop` that itself
raises during unwind aborts the frame (matches the HIR interpreter, which `?`-propagates from its
unwind drops).

## Surfacing and testing

`Interpreter::run_main` and `CompilerSession::run_expr_via_ssa` return `Result<Value, RuntimeError>`,
so the SSA backend reports errors instead of panicking. The test harness runs failing snippets through
*both* backends under `Backend::Both` and asserts outcome parity (equal values, or equal
`RuntimeErrorKind`), and the drop-count tests in `tests/language/value.rs` (e.g.
`lexical_drop_runs_on_runtime_error`, `nested_scope_drops_run_innermost_first_on_runtime_error`,
`cross_frame_drops_run_callee_first_on_runtime_error`) pin that the SSA landing-pad chain drops the
right locals, in the right order, exactly once — checked against the HIR interpreter automatically.

## Known limitations

- Per-iteration / anonymous temporaries are dropped inline today, not via scope obligations; a raise
  mid-temporary-region relies on the HIR interpreter also only unwinding frame-owned locals (parity
  confirmed by tests, not assumed).
- An unresolved effect variable is treated as potentially fallible, which can emit a never-taken
  unwind edge (harmless dead block) in generic code; a later pass can tighten this via the resolved
  effect row.
- A `Value::drop` raising during unwind aborts the frame rather than running an LLVM-style
  `terminate`; a documented divergence chosen for HIR parity.
